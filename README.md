# Prediction-of-Ranking-Womens-College-Volleyball
The goal of this study is to determine which factors are significant in winning percentage calculation by using multiple linear regression and logit regression. By using the 334 teams during the 2017 season, this study provides the prediction of winning percentages for obtaining positive results in NCAA division I women’s volleyball. The results from the multiple linear regression show that winning percentage can be explained not only by my team’s performance (Kills = 0.06 [0.001, 0.11], Errors = -0.06 [-0.008, -0.04], Aces= 0.04 [-0.00, 0.07]), but also opponent’s performance (Opp Kills = -0.06 [-0.009, -0.04], Opp Errors = 0.12 [0.008, 0.152]. The odds of significant factors are calculated in the logistic model (Kills odds = 1.03 [1.02, 1.04], Errors odds = 0.98 [0.97, 0.99], Opp Kills Odds = 0.97 [0.97, 0.99], Opp Errors odds = 1.03 [1.02, 1.05]). Based off of these results coaches and players at the division I level should not only consider focusing on the improvement of their own performance skills, but should take into account limiting and decreasing opponent’s performance.
